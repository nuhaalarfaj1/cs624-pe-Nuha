In this exercise I build to do app we start with a components and container components through using a basic implementation of React Native components by display a heading, a text input, a button, and a tab bar, first creating the App.js and import a new component called Scroll View which wraps the platform “Scroll View” and is basically a scrollable View component, then initial state for some of the values class, and and initialize these values in the state, then create  Heading component and styling it, bring it to App.js, after that create the Text Input component and give it some styling, and in this step I needed a wire up a function to get the value of the Text Input and save it to the state of the App component. And add a new function called input Change to App.js that will update the state value of” input Value, the last part by creating the Button and wired it up with the function defined in App.js and import the Button, after refreshing the app the app state log to the console showing an array of “todos” with the new” todo” in the array. Great and fun experience looking forward to continuing this app.
